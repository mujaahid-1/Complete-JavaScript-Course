// *** Printing hello world ***
console.log("Hello World");

// *** Variables and values ***
let myName = "Mujaahid";
// Variable   // Value

// Variable = We use variables to store values so they can be reused throughout the program.
// Value = A value is a specific piece of data, such as a number, a character, or a Boolean, that can be stored in a variable.
console.log(myName); // It will displa/print Mujaahid in the console inside the dev tools.

// A variable name can contain: Letters: a–z, A–Z, Digits: 0–9 (but not as the first character), Underscores: _, Dollar signs: $ other than that not allowed.

// Make your variables descriptive for ex
let myFirstJob = "Programmer";
let myCurrentJob = "Teacher"; // this one is better and recommended.

let job1 = "Programmer";
let job2 = "Teacher"; // this is allowed but it's not a good practice and not descriptive.
